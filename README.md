## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmahmoud153/wa-fn-usec-hr-employee-attrition)

The dataset contains several employee-related features believed to influence attrition. These features are organized as follows:

### Feature Categories:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - MaritalStatus
  - Department
  - JobRole
  - JobLevel
  - JobSatisfaction
  - YearsAtCompany
  - MonthlyIncome
  - DailyRate
  - PercentSalaryHike
  - WorkLifeBalance
  - OverTime
  - BusinessTravel
  - YearsSinceLastPromotion
  - YearsWithCurrManager

### Target Variable:
- **Attrition:** Binary classification target variable
  - **Yes**: Employee left the company.
  - **No**: Employee is still with the company.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
The following features are considered crucial for predicting employee attrition:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, MaritalStatus
- **Job-Related:** Department, JobRole, JobLevel, JobSatisfaction, YearsAtCompany
- **Compensation:** MonthlyIncome, DailyRate, PercentSalaryHike
- **Work-Life:** WorkLifeBalance, OverTime, BusinessTravel
- **Tenure Metrics:** YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager

---

## 🔍 Notable Insights

### **Attrition Drivers:**
Several factors are likely to influence employee attrition, including:
- **Low Job Satisfaction**: Employees with lower job satisfaction are more likely to leave.
- **Overtime**: Employees working overtime regularly may experience burnout and higher attrition.
- **Limited Promotion Opportunities**: Employees with fewer opportunities for promotion tend to leave more frequently.
- **Work-Life Imbalance**: Employees reporting poor work-life balance may be more likely to leave.

### **High-Risk Groups:**
Employees in the following groups may be at a higher risk for attrition:
- Frequent business travelers.
- Employees in lower job levels or positions.
- Employees with shorter tenures, particularly those with less than a few years at the company.

## 📌 Implementation Steps
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values** (if any)
- **Feature Scaling** using StandardScaler and LabelEncoder(for one-hot)
- **Splitting Data** into training and testing sets
- **Encoding Target Variable** (Converting into classification problem)

### **2️⃣ Model Training**
We implemented **6 ML models**:
- **Logistic Regression** 📉
- **Random Forest** 🌳
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🔍
- **Decision Tree** 🌿
- **Gradient Boosting** 📈
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** 🏹

### **3️⃣ Model Evaluation**
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
